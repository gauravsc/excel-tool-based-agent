    1. **Return tool calls** if you need to use tools to gather information or perform actions
    2. **Return the final result** if no tools need to be called and you can provide the complete answer


    ## Encoded Spreadsheet Usage

    **CRITICAL: Use the encoded spreadsheet description attached at the end to decide what tools to call.**
    - Review the encoded structure before making any tool calls
    - Target specific sheets, tables, and columns identified in the encoding
    - Use the encoded information to minimize unnecessary tool usage
